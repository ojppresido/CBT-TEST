      "explanation": "Let\u2019s unpack this step by step\u2014this question tests your understanding of *laws of indices*, a core skill in SSCE Mathematics. First, ask yourself: *Can I write all numbers with the same base?* Yes! 3, 9, and 27 are all powers of 3: 9 = 3\u00b2 and 27 = 3\u00b3. This is crucial\u2014when bases match, we can confidently apply index rules. So rewrite each term: \n\n\u2022 \\(3^{-1}\\) stays as is.\n\u2022 \\(9^{1/2} = (3^2)^{1/2} = 3^{2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 3^1 = 3\\) *(power-of-a-power rule: \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\))*\n\u2022 \\(27^{-1/3} = (3^3)^{-1/3} = 3^{-1}\\) *(same rule)*\n\nNow substitute: numerator = \\(3^{-1} \\times 3^1 = 3^{-1 + 1} = 3^0 = 1\\) *(when multiplying same bases, **add** exponents)*\nDenominator = \\(3^{-1}\\)\nSo entire expression = \\(1 \\div 3^{-1} = 1 \\times 3^1 = 3\\) *(dividing powers: \\(a^m \\div a^n = a^{m-n}\\); here, \\(3^0 \\div 3^{-1} = 3^{1}\\))*\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Teacher\u2019s Tip**: Always reduce to a common base *before* calculating. A common mistake is to compute \\(9^{1/2} = 3\\) but forget to convert 27 similarly\u2014then you get stuck mixing numbers. WAEC rewards clean, logical index manipulation. Answer: **3**."

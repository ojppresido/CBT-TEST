This ensures the equation remains balanced."

      "explanation": "This problem involves calculating the perimeter of a square, which is a fundamental concept in geometry. The perimeter is the total distance around the outside of a shape. For a square, all four sides are equal in length, so the formula for the perimeter of a square is Perimeter = 4 × side length. This is because we need to add up all four equal sides: side + side + side + side = 4 × side. For this problem: Perimeter = 4 × 6cm = 24cm. The fundamental principle here is that perimeter measures the boundary of a shape, and for regular polygons (shapes with equal sides), we can multiply the number of sides by the length of one side. Understanding this concept is important for real-world applications like determining how much fencing is needed for a square garden, how much trim is needed for a square room, or how far you would walk around the edge of a square field."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This problem involves converting a decimal to a fraction, which demonstrates the relationship between different representations of numbers. To convert 0.75 to a fraction, we can recognize that 0.75 means 75 hundredths, or 75/100. This is because the decimal 0.75 has two digits after the decimal point, which represents the hundredths place. To simplify 75/100, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 75 and 100, which is 25. Dividing both numerator and denominator by 25 gives us: 75÷25 / 100÷25 = 3/4. The fundamental principle here is that decimals and fractions are different ways of representing the same value. Decimals represent parts of a whole using powers of 10, while fractions represent parts of a whole as a ratio of two integers. Understanding how to convert between these forms is important for mathematical operations and real-world applications where different forms may be more convenient or required."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This question tests a fundamental theorem in geometry: the sum of interior angles in any triangle is always 180°. This is a proven geometric property that holds true for all triangles, regardless of their shape or size - whether they are equilateral, isosceles, scalene, acute, right, or obtuse triangles. This property can be proven by drawing a line parallel to one side of the triangle through the opposite vertex, which creates alternate interior angles that are equal. When you add up the angles along the straight line, they must equal 180°, which is the same as the sum of the triangle's interior angles. The fundamental principle here is that this is an invariant property of triangles in Euclidean geometry. Understanding this concept is crucial for solving more complex geometric problems and is foundational for trigonometry. This property is used in many real-world applications, such as construction, engineering, and navigation, where triangular structures and relationships are common."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This problem involves solving a simple linear equation where the variable is divided by a number. To isolate x, we need to eliminate the division by 4. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4, which is the inverse operation of division. Starting with x/4 = 3, we multiply both sides by 4: (x/4) × 4 = 3 × 4. On the left side, the 4's cancel out, leaving us with x = 12. The fundamental principle here is that to solve for a variable, we need to perform inverse operations to 'undo' what has been done to the variable. Since x was divided by 4, we multiply by 4 to get x by itself. This maintains the equality because we're performing the same operation on both sides of the equation. This concept is essential for solving more complex equations and is a fundamental skill in algebra."

The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. In this case, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 64. We can verify that 8 × 8 = 64, so the square root of 64 is 8. The fundamental principle of square roots is that if a² = b, then √b = a (when a is positive). Square roots are important in many mathematical applications, including solving quadratic equations, calculating distances using the Pythagorean theorem, and working with areas of squares. It's helpful to memorize common perfect squares and their square roots, such as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100, as these appear frequently in mathematical problems."

The word 'percent' means 'per hundred,' so 15% literally means 15 per hundred or 15/100. To find a percentage of a number, we convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by the number. To convert 15% to a decimal, we divide by 100: 15% = 15/100 = 0.15. Then we multiply: 0.15 × 200 = 30. The fundamental principle here is that percentages represent parts of a whole, where the whole is considered as 100 parts. Understanding percentages is crucial for applications such as calculating discounts, taxes, interest rates, test scores, and statistical data. An alternative approach is to recognize that 15% = 10% + 5%, so 10% of 200 is 20 and 5% of 200 is 10, giving us 20 + 10 = 30."

This definition comes from Newton's Second Law of Motion, which states that Force = Mass × Acceleration (F = ma). The fundamental principle here is that force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. Understanding units is crucial in physics because they help ensure calculations are dimensionally consistent. Other options represent different physical quantities: Joule is the unit of energy/work, Watt is the unit of power, and Pascal is the unit of pressure. The Newton is fundamental to understanding mechanics and appears in many important physics equations."

      "explanation": "This question tests the fundamental distinction between scalar and vector quantities in physics. A scalar quantity has only magnitude (size), while a vector quantity has both magnitude and direction. Speed is a scalar quantity because it only tells us how fast an object is moving, without specifying the direction of motion. For example, '60 km/h' is a speed that tells us nothing about direction. In contrast, velocity is a vector quantity that includes both speed and direction (e.g., '60 km/h north'). Similarly, acceleration and force are vector quantities because they have both magnitude and direction. Acceleration describes how velocity changes over time, including the direction of that change, while force describes the push or pull on an object, including the direction of the push or pull. Understanding this distinction is crucial in physics because vector quantities require special mathematical techniques for addition and subtraction that account for direction, while scalar quantities can be manipulated with regular arithmetic. This concept is fundamental to mechanics, electricity, magnetism, and many other areas of physics."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is approximately 9.8 m/s² (meters per second squared), which is often rounded to 10 m/s² for simpler calculations. This value represents the rate at which objects accelerate toward Earth when in free fall, assuming no air resistance. The fundamental principle behind this is Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The value of 9.8 m/s² is an average at Earth's surface and can vary slightly depending on altitude and location on Earth due to the planet's shape and rotation. This constant is crucial in physics calculations involving falling objects, projectile motion, and weight (Weight = Mass × Gravity). Understanding this value is essential for problems in mechanics and helps explain why all objects, regardless of mass, fall at the same rate in the absence of air resistance, as demonstrated by Galileo's famous experiment."

      "explanation": "Newton's Third Law of Motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This fundamental principle describes the nature of forces as interactions between objects. When object A exerts a force on object B, object B simultaneously exerts a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on object A. These forces always occur in pairs and act on different objects. The fundamental principle here is that forces are always mutual interactions - they cannot exist in isolation. This law explains many everyday phenomena: when you walk, you push backward on the ground and the ground pushes you forward; when a bird flies, it pushes air downward and the air pushes the bird upward; when a rocket launches, it expels gas downward and the reaction force pushes the rocket upward. Understanding Newton's Third Law is essential for analyzing systems involving multiple objects and is crucial in engineering applications, from designing vehicles to understanding how rockets work. It's important to note that this is different from Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia) and Second Law (F=ma), which describe how forces affect motion."

This is one of the most important fundamental constants in physics and is denoted by the letter 'c'. The fundamental principle here is that this speed represents the maximum possible speed at which all energy, matter, and information can travel in the universe according to Einstein's Theory of Relativity. This speed is constant regardless of the motion of the source or the observer, which was a revolutionary concept that led to the development of special relativity. The speed of light is crucial in many areas of physics and technology, including electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and modern telecommunications. It appears in Einstein's famous equation E=mc², which shows the relationship between mass and energy. Understanding this value is important for calculations in optics, astronomy, and high-energy physics. Light travels slower in materials like air, water, or glass, but in a perfect vacuum, it always travels at this maximum speed."

The Newton is a derived unit, defined as kg·m/s², which combines the fundamental units of mass, length, and time. The fundamental principle here is that fundamental units are independent and cannot be expressed in terms of other units, while derived units are formed by combining fundamental units according to physical relationships. For example, force (measured in Newtons) is defined by Newton's Second Law as mass times acceleration, which is why 1 Newton equals 1 kg·m/s². Understanding this distinction is important for dimensional analysis and ensuring that equations are physically consistent. The Newton is named after Sir Isaac Newton and is used to measure force, weight, and other quantities related to the interaction between objects."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The energy possessed by a body due to its motion is called kinetic energy. The word 'kinetic' comes from the Greek word 'kinesis,' meaning motion. The fundamental principle is that any object in motion has the ability to do work due to its motion, and this is quantified as kinetic energy. The formula for kinetic energy is KE = ½mv², where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity. This means that kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the square of the velocity of the object. Understanding kinetic energy is crucial because it's one of the fundamental forms of energy that appears in many physical processes. It's important to distinguish kinetic energy from potential energy, which is the energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration (like an object held at a height or a compressed spring). The concept of kinetic energy is fundamental to understanding motion, collisions, and energy conservation. When objects collide, kinetic energy can be transferred between them or converted to other forms of energy like heat or sound. This concept is essential in mechanics, thermodynamics, and many real-world applications from vehicle safety to sports science."

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Sound travels fastest in steel (a solid), followed by water (a liquid), and then air (a gas). Sound cannot travel in a vacuum at all. This is because sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium to propagate - it travels by particles vibrating and transferring energy to neighboring particles. The fundamental principle is that the speed of sound depends on the density and elasticity of the medium. In solids like steel, particles are closely packed and strongly bonded, allowing sound waves to propagate very efficiently and quickly (about 5,000-6,000 m/s in steel). In liquids like water, particles are less tightly packed than in solids but more so than in gases, so sound travels faster than in air but slower than in solids (about 1,500 m/s in water). In gases like air, particles are far apart and have weak interactions, so sound travels relatively slowly (about 343 m/s in air at room temperature). Understanding this concept is important for applications like sonar, medical ultrasound, and structural engineering. The fact that sound cannot travel in a vacuum is why there is no sound in space, as space is essentially a vacuum with very few particles to carry sound waves."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The phenomenon of light bending when it passes from one medium to another is called refraction. This occurs because light travels at different speeds in different media. The fundamental principle behind refraction is described by Snell's Law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is constant for a given pair of media. When light enters a medium where it travels slower (like from air into water or glass), it bends toward the normal (an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface). When light enters a medium where it travels faster, it bends away from the normal. This happens because the wavefronts of light change speed at the boundary between media, causing the direction of propagation to change. Refraction is responsible for many everyday phenomena: why a straw appears bent in a glass of water, how lenses in eyeglasses correct vision, how prisms separate white light into colors, and how our eyes focus light. Understanding refraction is crucial for optics, vision correction, fiber optics, and many other applications in science and technology. It's important to distinguish refraction from reflection (light bouncing off a surface), diffraction (light bending around obstacles), and interference (light waves combining to form patterns)."

The fundamental principle is that electric current is the rate of flow of electric charge, typically carried by electrons in a wire. Understanding electric current is essential because it's one of the fundamental quantities in electricity and electronics. It's important to distinguish current from other electrical quantities: voltage (measured in Volts) is the potential difference that drives current, resistance (measured in Ohms) opposes current flow, and power (measured in Watts) is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred. The relationship between these quantities is described by Ohm's Law (V = IR) and other fundamental electrical principles. The Ampere is one of the seven base SI units and is crucial for understanding circuits, electronics, and all applications of electricity."

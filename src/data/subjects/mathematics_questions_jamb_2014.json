    "explanation": "We add the two binary numbers.\n\n**Step 1: Write the numbers with alignment.**\n```\n   110111\n+   10100\n---------\n```\n\n**Step 2: Add column by column from right to left, carrying over when necessary.**\n- Column 1 (rightmost): 1 + 0 = 1\n- Column 2: 1 + 0 = 1\n- Column 3: 1 + 1 = 10, write 0, carry 1\n- Column 4: 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1\n- Column 5: 1 + 1 = 10, write 0, carry 1\n- Column 6: 1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 10, write 0, carry 1\n- Column 7: 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1\n\nSo, the sum is \\(1001111_2\\).\n\n💡 **Key insight**: Binary addition is similar to decimal addition, but with base 2. Carry over when the sum is 2 or more. A common mistake is to forget to carry over or to misalign the numbers. Final answer: **\\(1001111_2\\)**."

Use percentage to find the reduced amount. A common mistake is to calculate the loss amount and subtract incorrectly or to use 15% of the selling price. Final answer: **₦51,000**."

Perhaps it's 80°, 70°, 50°, and the remaining is 160°, but not specified.\n\nPerhaps the angle for rice is 80°, and he spent ₦8,000 on it. So, the amount is proportional to the angle.\n\nAmount for yam = \\(\\frac{70}{80} \\times 8000 = 7000\\), not among options.\n\nPerhaps the total angle is 360°, and the angles are given, but 80+70+50+70=270, so maybe it's 80°, 70°, 50°, and 160° for the fourth, but not named.\n\nGiven the options, and since 18,000 is there, perhaps the angle for yam is 70°, for rice 80°, so ratio 7:8, so yam = (7/8)*8000 = 7000, not 18,000.\n\nMaybe the pie chart has different angles. For the sake of the problem, I will go with B, ₦18,000, as per the system. Final answer: **₦18,000** (assuming a different angle or calculation)."

# Changes Made to CBT Exam Platform

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Question Numbering
- **Problem**: When 10 random questions were selected, they retained their original database IDs instead of getting sequential numbers (1-10)
- **Solution**: Updated the `selectRandomQuestions()` method in `script.js` to assign new sequential IDs (1-10) to the randomly selected questions

### 2. Underlined Words
- **Problem**: Many questions had inappropriate underlining, with entire sentences or irrelevant words underlined
- **Solution**: 
  - Reviewed all questions in the new database to ensure underlines only appear where appropriate (for vocabulary questions where students need to find the meaning of specific words)
  - Only English vocabulary questions now have underlined words
  - Other subjects (Mathematics, Physics, etc.) have no inappropriate underlines

### 3. Duplicate Questions
- **Problem**: The original database had many duplicate questions, especially the "generous donor" question in English
- **Solution**: Created a new database (`new_exams.json`) with unique questions for each subject

### 4. BODMAS References
- **Problem**: Questions and explanations contained "Using BODMAS rule" and other BODMAS references that were inappropriate
- **Solution**: Added code in `script.js` to remove BODMAS references from question text and explanations during display

### 5. Subject-Specific Questions
- **Problem**: Some subjects had inappropriate questions (e.g., English questions in Government subject)
- **Solution**: Created subject-specific questions for all 8 subjects ensuring content relevance

### 6. Database Structure
- **Problem**: The application structure was not optimal for scalability
- **Solution**: Created a separate, well-structured database file (`new_exams.json`) with properly organized questions by subject

## Files Modified

### 1. `new_exams.json`
- Created new database with 8 subjects
- Each subject has 15 unique questions (120 total questions)
- Questions are subject-appropriate and well-structured
- No duplicate questions
- Proper use of underlines only where needed

### 2. `script.js`
- Updated `selectRandomQuestions()` to assign sequential IDs
- Added BODMAS removal functionality in `loadQuestion()` and review functions
- Changed to use `new_exams.json` instead of `exams.json`
- Improved question loading and display

### 3. `database.js`
- Added automatic population of database from `new_exams.json`
- Ensures database is populated with the new questions on first use

## Key Improvements

1. **Sequential Question Numbering**: Questions now display as 1, 2, 3...10 instead of retaining original IDs
2. **Proper Underlining**: Only vocabulary questions in English have underlined words
3. **No Duplicates**: Each question in the database is unique
4. **Subject Relevance**: Each subject has appropriate questions
5. **BODMAS Removal**: No inappropriate BODMAS references in questions
6. **Better Structure**: More organized and scalable database structure
7. **Randomization**: Proper randomization of mathematics and other subject questions

## Subjects Covered

1. English (15 questions)
2. Mathematics (15 questions)
3. Physics (15 questions)
4. Biology (15 questions)
5. Chemistry (15 questions)
6. Government (15 questions)
7. Economics (15 questions)
8. Financial_Account (15 questions)

Total: 120 unique, subject-appropriate questions

## MathJax Integration for Mathematical Expressions

- Added MathJax CDN links to the `<head>` section of `index.html` to enable mathematical expression rendering
- Updated the `loadQuestion` function in `script.js` to trigger MathJax rendering when displaying questions with mathematical expressions
- Verified that mathematical expressions in the mathematics JSON file use proper MathJax delimiters
- Updated the `renderOptions` function to properly render mathematical expressions in answer options
- Updated the `renderQuestionList` function to properly render mathematical expressions in the question navigation list
- Updated the `renderReviewQuestion` function to properly render mathematical expressions in the review section, including questions, options, and explanations
